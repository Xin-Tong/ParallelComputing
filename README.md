# ParallelComputing
童心是个大SB!
Program a map reduce that executes on a distributed memory machine and uses OpenMP on each core to compute the map reduce. 

The project will be done in three steps:
    1. The OpenMP version and a wordcount map reduce. 
    2. The MPI version that uses the OpenMP version to perform node-local computation with a wordcount map reduce.
    3. Final turn-in.
